A collection of documentation covering the Arc XP unified mobile SDK and sample projects.

## Backend Setup

Before any of Arc XP's services can be used, a backend must be ready to connect to. See the reference below for more details. 

* [Backend setup for Mobile SDK](docs/back-end-setup-for-mobile-sdk.md)

## Sample Apps

Arc XP's mobile sample apps demonstrate what using Arc XP services in real world applications might look like, while also providing a starting point for updating and customizing the project into something more suited to a specific client.


When it comes to cross platform development and using our mobile SDK we have experimented with React Native and found a way to incorporate our SDK into a RN project. Please see the article here: [Using Mobile SDK with React Native](docs/using-mobile-sdk-with-react-native.md)
